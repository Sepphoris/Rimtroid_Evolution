-DD (Dragon's Descent) Team for the framework, teaser images, and overall xml help; without them, this would be a MUCH different and less accurate mod.
-Taranchuk for his amazing coding abilities that cover 90% of the mod, and dealing with my constant pestering about C#
-Ogliss and Murmur for other areas of the C# coding, which helped bring the mod together
-Kasmex Forever, for doing nearly all the graphics within the mod, and bringing up all the Metroids to a much higher quality than my own.
-The general RW modding community for helping solve various issues that popped up, and troubleshooting oversights and errors.
